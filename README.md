**Hey, there!**

**I’m Christian, and I’m passionate about creating educational tech content for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.**

This Repository **Homelab** contains all my homelab documentation files. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@christianlempa).

## Contribution

As this is my personal Homelab documentation, I don't accept any contributions. But feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own documentation.

Creating high-quality videos and valuable resources that are accessible to everyone, free of charge, is a huge challenge. With your contribution, I can dedicate more time and effort into the creation process, which ultimately enhances the quality of the content.
